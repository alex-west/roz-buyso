$Getting Started.

   If you can't quite figure out what to
do in this game, remember the following:

   *  If you see something unusual, try
      touching it.  The worst that can
      happen is... Death!

   *  Don't forget that you can usually
      leave the room you are in by walking
      off the edge of the screen.

   *  Save the game often.  Then, if you
      get stuck or you die, you can just
      go back and restore it where you
      left off.

   *  Keep an open mind.  This is ZZT,
      The Object-Oriented Game, and just
      about anything can (and probably
      will) happen.

$Health points

   When you begin a new game,  you start
with 100 health points.  Every time you
get shot or touched by a creature,  you
lose 10.  When your health reaches zero,
the game is over.

   You can regain health by picking up
gems - each gem gives you 1 health point.

$Using the Keyboard

   To move around, use the four cursor
keys or the numeric keypad.

   To shoot, hold down the [Shift] key
and press the cursor key in the direction
you wish to shoot.


$Using a Joystick

   ZZT fully supports joystick operation.
To move, just point the joystick in the
desired direction.  To shoot, hold down
the button then move the stick in the
direction you wish to shoot.

   To use a joystick, you must say so when
you first run ZZT and you are prompted
"Keyboard, Joystick, Mouse?".  If you
have not done this, leave the program
and start over.

   At times, you may prefer to use the
keyboard for more accurate maneuvers.


$Using a Mouse

   To move, just drag the mouse in the
desired direction.  You will have to
keep dragging the mouse as long as
you want to move.

   To move continually in a certain
direction, first hold down the right-hand
button on the mouse.  Next, push the
mouse slightly in the direction you wish
to move.  You will continue moving in that
direction, without any effort, until
the button is released.

   To fire, just hold down the left-hand
mouse button and push the mouse gently
in the direction you wish to shoot.

   At times, you may prefer to use the
keyboard for more accurate maneuvers.
