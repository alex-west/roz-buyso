$Terrains

     Terrains are the most important part
of any ZZT board because they form the
foundation upon which the game's action
is based.

     Walls, Boulders, Forest, and other
terrains can be arranged to form puzzles,
mazes, and scenery.  Each type of terrain
has unique properties.

$Water

     Neither players nor creatues can
travel through water, but bullets pass
freely over it.  The player must
maneuver around water, taking care to
avoid bullets passing over it.

     Sharks are the only kind of creature
that can travel through water, but they
can not move through land.

$Forest

     The player can move through forest,
clearing a path behind him.  Creatures
can not move through forest, but readily
follow the player through cleared paths.

$Solid and Normal Walls

     These walls form a barrier that is
always impenetrable.  Nobody walks through
walls.  Period.

$Breakable Walls

     These walls also block the player and
all creatures, but can be destroyed.

     When a breakable wall is shot with a
bullet, one piece of the wall disappears.
Also, when a bomb explodes, all breakable
walls in the vicinity of the bomb are
destroyed.

$Boulders

     Boulders are solid objects that can
be pushed around by the player.

     By combining boulders, pushers,
walls, and other objects, a variety of
challenging thought puzzles can be
created.

$Sliders

     Sliders are similar to boulders, but
are confined to move in a line.  A slider
looks like a line with two arrows at
opposite ends, and can only move in the
direction of the arrows.

$Fake walls

     Fake walls look exactly like normal
walls, but have no effect on the player.
The player can walk over fake walls just
as if they were empty space.  Fake walls
are meant for creating secret passages.

$Invisible walls

     Invisible walls look like empty space
to the player, but prevent the player
from moving over them.  When the player
touches an invisible wall, it suddenly
appears as a normal wall.  Creatures can
not pass through invisible walls either.

$Blinking walls

     A blinking wall placed on the board
emitts a ray pointing in a specified
direction.  This ray blinks on and off
at a constant rate, and forms a barrier
that is difficult for the player to cross.

     When created, each blinking wall
must be assigned a starting time and
a duration.  By creating a line of
walls with the same duration but varying
start times, a moving wave appears.

$Transporter

     When the player enters a transporter,
he is magically moved to another area of
the board.

     Each transporter points in a given
direction, and the player can only enter
the transporter from behind.  He is
then moved along a line, in the direction
of the transporter, to the nearest
transporter that points in the opposite
direction.
