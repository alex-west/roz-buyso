:ammo;Ammunition

     When the player touches a unit of
ammo, he receives five bullets.


:torches;Torches.

     A Torch gives visibility in rooms
which are dark.  The player picks up a
torch by touching it, but the torch does
not become lit until the player activates
it by pressing "T".

     Torches last only a fraction of a
minute, and provide limited visibility in
rooms that are dark.

     To make a room dark, press "I" for
the Board Information Menu and select the
"Room is dark" option.


:gems;Gems.

     Gems are bonus points for a player.
Touching a gem awards the player ten
bonus points and one unit of health.

     By using ZZT-OOP's "GIVE" and "TAKE"
commands, you can create objects that
trade supplies or just about anything in
exchange for gems.


:keys;Keys.

     Keys are used to unlock doors.  They
are color-coded, so there are seven colors
of keys.  To unlock a door, the player
must posess a key of the same color.

     The player can not hold two keys of
the same color, though he can hold all
seven different-colored keys at the same
time.


:doors;Doors.

     Doors prevent the player from
entering a region.  To get through a door,
the player must be holding a matching
key.  If this is the case, then the door
will open and the player will lose
posession of the key.


:scrolls;Scrolls.

     Scrolls contain text messages, such
as hints, dialog, and puzzles.  When the
player touches a scroll, the message
appears for the player to read.

     If the scroll contains only one line
of text, the message will be flashed on
the bottom of the screen.  Otherwise,
a window will pop up and the player may
browse through the text.


:pass;Passages.

     A passage is a gateway to another
room.  When you place a passage on the
board, you must specify which room is 
through the passage.

     Whenever the player touches a
passage, he is transported to a new
room.  The player will be placed in the
new room as follows:

*  If there is a matching passage in the
   new room, the player will enter the
   destination room through it.  To
   match, the exit and entrance passages
   must be the same color.

*  Otherwise, the player will be arrive
   in the destination board on the spot
   where he appears in the board editor.


:dupes;Duplicators.

     A duplicator slowly replicates an
object placed next to it.

     First, put a creature somewhere on
the board.  Next, place a duplicator
adjacent to it, and specify the direction
pointing to the creature.  Finally, put
walls around the original creature so
that it remains next to the duplicator.

     Duplicators can be used to fill up
a board with creatures as a game
progresses.


:bombs;Bombs.

     The player activates a bomb by
touching it.  The bomb begins counting
down from 9, exploding when it reaches 1.
While a bomb is ticking, the player can
move it around by pushing it.

     When a bomb explodes, it will zap
all Creatures and Breakable Walls in
close proximity.


:energ;Energizers.

     Touching an energizer gives the
player a brief taste of invincibility.
During this time, the player changes
colors and is free to come into contact
with normally harmful creatures.


:conv;Conveyors.

     Conveyors cause adjacent objects to
move.  Both clockwise and counter-
clockwise rotating conveyors exist.

     By placing several conveyors
together, objects can be made to
circulate in nearly any desired pattern.
