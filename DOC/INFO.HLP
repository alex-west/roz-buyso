$Board information menu

     To bring up the board information
menu, press [I].  Listed in this menu are
all of the characteristics unique to the
room being edited.

$Title

     Each room has a unique title, which
you can change as desired.  The title of
the board you are editing is displayed at
the top of the screen.

$Can fire (#) shots

     This option determines the number of
bullets that the player can fire at the
same time.  A value of 1 indicates that
the player can only have one bullet on the
screen at any time.  The player can not
fire again until the bullet disappears.

     A value of zero indicates that the
player can fire any shots on the board.

$Board is dark

     Use this option to darken a room.
The player must use a torch to see in a
darkened room, and even then only has
limited visibility.

$Board up/down/left/right

     Use these options to link rooms
together so that the player can move from
one room to another by moving off the
screen.

     Note:  When you link one board to
another, the other is not automatically
linked to the first.  You must manually
switch to the second board and then link
it to the first.

$Re-enter when zapped

     When this option is on and the player
is shot or touched by an enemy, he will be
moved back to the position where he
entered the room.

     Otherwise, the player will remain
the same place when shot.

$Time limit

     A limit can be imposed on the amount
of time the player can spend in a room.
Once that time expires, the player is
zapped and the counter starts over.

     A time limit of 0 implies that there
is no limit to the amount of time the
player can spend in a room.

     When you impose a time limit on a
room, be sure you also turn on the
"Re-enter when zapped" option, or else the
time limit becomes somewhat meaningless.
