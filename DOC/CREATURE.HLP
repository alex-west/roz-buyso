Attributes:

     Many types of creatures have
attributes, such as intelligence,
sensitivity, and direction, that can be
customized.  These attributes affect
different aspects of a creature's
movement.

     Some creatures have an Intelligence
setting.  This affects how well the
creature will find the player.  One with a
low intelligence moves largely at random,
while an intelligent creature actively
follows the player.

Note:

     There is not space to describe each
creature in much detail.  You must learn
by experimenting and watching the behavior
of all of the creatures.


:bears;Bears:

     Bears are attracted to the player
when the two are close together.  Their
goal is to attack the player.

     When a bear comes into contact with
a Breakable Wall, both disappear.


:ruffians;Ruffians:

     Ruffians move sporadically,
alternately moving and resting.  They
will try to catch the player.


:objects;Objects:

     Objects are a versatile kind of
creature and can be customized using the
ZZT-OOP programming language.

     When placing an Object on the
board, you may pick any character to
represent it.  Then, you enter commands
to control the creature during game play.

     If you want to modify the program of
an already-existing Object, position the
cursor above it and press [ENTER].

:slime;Slime:

     A single Slime will spread out by
replicating itself until an entire region
is filled.  Slime only oozes through empty
space, so it is blocked by walls.

     As slime spreads out, it leaves a
trail of breakable walls.  The player can
stop the slime by touching it;  the only
threat it poses is in trapping the player.


:sharks;Sharks:

     Sharks travel through water only, and
hurt the player upon contact.  They are
not harmed by bullets.


:guns;Spinning guns:

     Spinning guns rotate and shoot in
random directions.  By placing walls on
various sides of a gun, it can be aimed
in any desired direction.


:pushers;Pushers:

     Pushers move slowly in a given
direction, pushing Boulders and Sliders
ahead of them.  They can move the
player, but do not pose a direct threat.


:lions;Lions:

     Lions move quickly about the board,
attracted to the player according to their
intelligence.  Lions can not shoot.


:tigers;Tigers:

     Tigers move toward the player and
shoot bullets.

     These bullets are harmful only
to the player.  In fact, no creatures will
directly harm other creatures.


:centis;Centipedes:

     These are the most interesting type
of creature, because they can contain
many different parts linked together.

     A Centipede consists of a Head and
several body Segments.  The Head decides
where to move, and the body follows
behind.

     To place a Centipede on the board,
first place the Head, then put Body
segments along side, in a line.  All parts
must be in contact.

     When a Centipede is shot, it will
break up into two smaller centipedes,
which move independently.
